# ChukNorrisCipherEncoderProject

Learning outcomes
This project will allow us to deal with string and character variables and work with loops and conditional statements. Get familiar with the binary notation and data type conversion. Create an application for the unary representation and decoding of any text.

About
Secret agents use encryption all the time. You know that everything can be encrypted as different characters. What about encryption that uses only one character and space? This method has a name â€” the Chuck Norris cipher. In this project, you will create a program that can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this sequence into text.



Stage 1/5: Analyze the words
Description
To begin with, you will learn how to divide an encrypted message into the characters that it contains. You will need this for further work.

Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line.
Output all characters in the string, separated by one space (including the space characters themselves).
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

Input string:
> Greetings!

G r e e t i n g s !
Example 2:

Input string:
> Who am I?

W h o   a m   I ?
